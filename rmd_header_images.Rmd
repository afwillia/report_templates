To create a pdf with header from Rmarkdown, you need two things, the correct YAML header and a header.tex file.

Your YAML header should contain the follow at minimum:

output:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;pdf_document:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;includes:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in_header: header.tex  

Each line is indented by two spaces. Another trick: Since Rmarkdown doesn't support indentation (adding spaces at the beginning of a line doesn't do anything), use '&nbsp' to create spaces.  

The header.tex file identifies, positions, and sizes the images within the header: 

```{r engine='bash', echo=FALSE}

cat header.tex

```

### This is a section

What does the .tex file look like?

\subsection{Section 2}\label{Section 2}
This is a section created with latex. Use \\subsection{name}\\label{name}. Useful for adding sections around plots and tables generated inside of a chunk.
